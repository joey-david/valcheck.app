activate python virtual environment (package isolation, etc, essentially a virtual machine)
--> source /venv/bin/activate

start server : python3 server.py
start frontend : npm start in the directory of package.json

package.json keeps track of things, so npm init on a new machine does what you seek.

plan : 
complete as much of the frontend as possible except for explanation and demonstration, mock image sending and text retrieval, mock gifs. Deadline -> 11/10/24 ideally, 12/10/24 worst case.
build a digit recognition model. Deadline 19/10/24 ideally, 26/10/24 worst case.
implement


add to resume:
transformer models, foundation models, generative models, or graph neutral networks
